Metadata for manuscript entitled “Temporal constancy in the structure of a spider-focused food web with high rates of intraguild predation”.

Repository description:

R scripts, SAS models, description of analyses, and data used to estimate how interaction evenness, restricted connectance, and intraguild predation changed as a function of year and season in a spider-focused forest-floor food web.

File descriptions:

Contingency_4x3x2_Analysis_Description.txt:  The full description of the 4 x 3 x 2 contingency table analysis using a log-linear model with a log link function and a Poisson distribution to test if there is an interaction between year and season for spider intraguild predation.

Contingency Analysis.sas:  The code to run the 4 x 3 x 2 contingency table analysis; the analysis was performed using SAS.

Figs. 4-7.R:  The underlying R code to recreate Figures 4 to 7 presented in the main manuscript, which presents the results on interaction evenness, restricted connectance, and intraguild predation. This code requires importing files “IGP-season-by-year.csv”, “interaction_evenness.csv”, “intraguild_predation.csv”, and “restricted_connectance.csv” to run.

IGP-season-by-year.csv:  Data on the changes in spider intraguild predation by year and season. This file supports the data shown in Figure 7 of the manuscript.

interaction_evenness.csv:  Data for showing interaction evenness pooled by year and season. This file supports the data shown in Figure 5 of the manuscript.

intraguild_predation.csv:  Data for showing percent intraguild predation pooled by year and season. This file supports the data shown in Figure 6 of the manuscript.

restricted_connectance.csv:  Data for showing percent intraguild predation pooled by year and season. This file supports the data shown in Figure 6 of the manuscript.

PCR Bootstrapping Analysis.R:  The underlying R code to calculate the PCR-based bootstrapped-derived confidence intervals (BCI’s) for two indices of overall network structure, restricted connectance and interaction evenness, overlapped broadly across both years and seasons.

Season_Fall_PCR.txt:  The spider food web interaction matrix for the Fall season. This data helps support Figure 3 in the main text.

Season_Spring_PCR.txt:  The spider food web interaction matrix for the Spring season. This data helps support Figure 3 in the main text.

Season_Summer_PCR.txt:  The spider food web interaction matrix for the Fall season. This data helps support Figure 3 in the main text.

Spider-food-web.Rproj:  The R Studio Project that hosts the R environment to run most of the analyses (i.e., the scripts named “PCR Bootstrapping Analysis.R” and “Figs. 4-7.R”).

Summary_PCR.txt:  The basic interaction matrix for the full summary spider food web. This data helps support Figure 1 in the main text.

Summary_PCR_RawData.csv:  The raw PCR data for calculating the PCR-based bootstrapped-derived confidence intervals (BCI’s) for two indices of overall network structure, restricted connectance and interaction evenness, overlapped broadly across both years and seasons.
Year_2009_PCR.txt:  The spider food web interaction matrix for the year 2009. This data helps support Figure 2 in the main text.

Year_2010_PCR.txt:  The spider food web interaction matrix for the year 2010. This data helps support Figure 2 in the main text.

Year_2011_PCR.txt:  The spider food web interaction matrix for the year 2011. This data helps support Figure 2 in the main text.

Year_2012_PCR.txt: The spider food web interaction matrix for the year 2012. This data helps support Figure 2 in the main text.

4x3x2_IGP_Data_Matrix.xlsx:  The data used to run the 4 x 3 x 2 contingency table analysis using a log-linear model with a log link function and a Poisson distribution.

Note: All R files must be imported into your working directory for the analysis to work. The 4x3x2 Contingency Analysis was conducted using SAS; the underlying code is provided in “Contingency Analysis.sas” with the underlying description provided the file named “Contingency_4x3x2_Analysis_Description.odt”.
